## CrowdLearning (OL) powered by Hedera 

CrowdLearning is an application that outsources imitation learning using dagger to the public where in a user can help training a model and earn micropayments through **Hedera** each time they help improve the existing model.
To demo our project, we will be using an autonomous self-driving car simulation which is currently not very accurate and you shall see how a user will help improve the models accuracy in a game simulation and earn hbar credits each time the model is improved.
