### Pay Per Info
This project introduces a new concept called "Pay Per Info" using Hedera micropayment services. The idea is about instead of forcing a user to take a complete subscription of organization's premium services where user is only interested in subset of the services. Instead user will be charged only for the services he wants to consume.

#### Hedera Hashgraph
Earlier micro payments were not a rage because of transaction cost attached to it, which affets the organizations revenue or an individual but after intrduction of Hbar by hedera the transaction charges reduces `1/100` of a penny.
